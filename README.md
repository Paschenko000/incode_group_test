Test Project for Incode Groupe

Project Overview

The app allows users to select from a list of houses, each represented by a hardcoded name, in a simple game format. The house data is stored in a constant due to the lack of an external API, making it important to note that any future API changes to house names could lead to functionality issues.

	Important Note: The current setup relies on static house names stored in the code. If house names differ in future API updates, the game may not work as expected without additional mapping or error-handling logic.

Features

	•	House Selection Game: Users can pick a house from a predefined list.
	•	React Context for State Management: Centralized global state is handled using React’s Context API, ensuring accessibility throughout the app’s components.
	•	Static Data Storage: House data is stored in a constant as a temporary solution, pending API availability.

Technologies Used

	•	React Native: Framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.
	•	React Context API: Used for centralized state management.
	•	JavaScript: Primary language for implementing functionality and app logic.
